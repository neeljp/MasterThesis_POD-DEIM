For this purpose, we first review the classical \{FDTD\} scheme and associated results for the 2D Maxwell equations in a lossy medium. And then, we formulate three sets of \{POD\} bases by means of the solutions obtained from the classical \{FDTD\} scheme on the very short time interval, establish the \{POD\} reduced-order \{FDTD\} extrapolating scheme, and furnish the error estimates among the \{POD\} reduced-order \{FDTD\} solutions and the classical \{FDTD\} solutions as well as the accuracy solution for the 2D Maxwell equations in a lossy medium. Finally, we enumerate two numerical examples to confirm that the \{POD\} reduced-order \{FDTD\} extrapolating scheme is feasible and efficient for simulating the phenomena for the electric and magnetic fields in a lossy medium.

abstract = "Abstract This article presents the first Reduced Order Model (ROM) that efficiently resolves the angular dimension of the time independent, mono-energetic Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE). It is based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and uses the method of snapshots to form optimal basis functions for resolving the direction of particle travel in neutron/photon transport problems. A unique element of this work is that the snapshots are formed from the vector of angular coefficients relating to a high resolution expansion of the BTE's angular dimension. In addition, the individual snapshots are not recorded through time, as in standard POD, but instead they are recorded through space. In essence this work swaps the roles of the dimensions space and time in standard \{POD\} methods, with angle and space respectively. It is shown here how the \{POD\} model can be formed from the \{POD\} basis functions in a highly efficient manner. The model is then applied to two radiation problems; one involving the transport of radiation through a shield and the other through an infinite array of pins. Both problems are selected for their complex angular flux solutions in order to provide an appropriate demonstration of the model's capabilities. It is shown that the \{POD\} model can resolve these fluxes efficiently and accurately. In comparison to high resolution models this \{POD\} model can reduce the size of a problem by up to two orders of magnitude without compromising accuracy. Solving times are also reduced by similar factors. "

abstract = "Abstract This article presents a new reduced order model based upon proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) for solving the Navier–Stokes equations. The novelty of the method lies in its treatment of the equation's non-linear operator, for which a new method is proposed that provides accurate simulations within an efficient framework. The method itself is a hybrid of two existing approaches, namely the quadratic expansion method and the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM), that have already been developed to treat non-linear operators within reduced order models. The method proposed applies the quadratic expansion to provide a first approximation of the non-linear operator, and \{DEIM\} is then used as a corrector to improve its representation. In addition to the treatment of the non-linear operator the \{POD\} model is stabilized using a Petrov–Galerkin method. This adds artificial dissipation to the solution of the reduced order model which is necessary to avoid spurious oscillations and unstable solutions. A demonstration of the capabilities of this new approach is provided by solving the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations for simulating a flow past a cylinder and gyre problems. Comparisons are made with other treatments of non-linear operators, and these show the new method to provide significant improvements in the solution's accuracy. "
